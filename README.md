# brainfuck-interpreter

A simple brainfuck interpreter made with C. I had made many brainfuck interpreters in multiple languages in the past when I didn't know about data structures like stack, and because of that they mostly didn't work very well :D So I decided to make this, and it seems to work quite well.

## Usage

Compile the source code, and then call `brainfuck <file>`.

## Known bugs

I forgot to make the memory size dynamic in `brainfuck.c`, and now I'm too lazy to fix it. Maybe someday!
